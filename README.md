# INFO 370 PROJECT

This repository holds the data (specifically the code) related to GoTeam's data science project in relation to political sentiment
within digital social environments (specifically Twitter).

There are a number of files each of which builds on another for specificity and clarity for analysis.

## DATA
	Go to the following link to access the different datasets used in this study:

#### EVEN
	(1) Visualualizations of FOLLOWERS, FOLLOWING => pol_accounts file that you cleaned
 	(2) LIKES AND RETWEETS => rerun the summary from the latest merged file

#### JAYLEN
	(1) Linear regression â€“ like we did in lab => early results
		
#### NIKI 
	(1) Turn democrat and republican into zeros and ones and do summary statistics 
	(2) Datetime try to get the strings into dates
  
#### ALLY 
	(1) Correlation matrix for followers, following, polarity, num_tweets,

#### EXTRA 
	Summary statistics of polarity
	Code for removing outliers => data =data[~(np.abs(data.distance-data.distance.mean()) > (3*data.distance.std()))] #remove outliers

## CODE FILES
	Once you've uploaded your code add a number to the list below and specify what your code did specifically to which datasets:
